# Test Case for Priority Scheduling
# - P3 and P4 have the highest priority (1). P3 should be chosen first because it arrives earlier.
# - P3 should be chosen over P2, even though P2 arrived earlier, because P3 has a higher priority.

# P1: Arrives first, medium priority
process name P1 arrival 0 burst 8 priority 3

# P2: Arrives, but P1 is running. Low priority.
process name P2 arrival 2 burst 4 priority 4

# P3: Arrives while P1 is running. HIGHEST priority. Should run right after P1 finishes.
process name P3 arrival 4 burst 6 priority 1

# P4: Arrives while P1 is running. Also HIGHEST priority, but arrived after P3.
# This will test the FCFS tie-breaker for equal priorities.
process name P4 arrival 5 burst 3 priority 1

# P5: Arrives later. Medium priority. Should run after the priority 1 jobs.
